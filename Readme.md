## Face Detection using OpenCV and MTCNN
This project involves identifying faces from image using the OpenCV and the MTCNN libaries in order to determine which of the libraries are more suitable for face detection applications. The images used for testing were obtained from Google Images. The pretrained model used with the OpenCV library for face detection can be obtained from the [OpenCV github project](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/data/haarcascades).
